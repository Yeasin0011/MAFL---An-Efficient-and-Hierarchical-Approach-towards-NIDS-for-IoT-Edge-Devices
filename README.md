# MAFL---An-Efficient-and-Hierarchical-Approach-towards-NIDS-for-IoT-Edge-Devices
MAFL is an efficient, hierarchical FL framework for IoT NIDS. It uses a lightweight 14K param. CNN-BiLSTM model and a novel Metric Annealed Aggregation strategy to selectively accept high-quality client updates, significantly reducing communication overhead (by 60%) and boosting accuracy on non-IID data.
